# Sassy Modular Scale

## Put down the calculator and let Sass do the work.

Sassy Modular Scale is a Sass based mixin that calculates the incremental values of the modular scale in proportion to a set size and ratio. It was inspired by and adapted from Tim Brown's modularscale.com.

Sassy Modular Scale can be used as a [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) [extension](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/extensions/) and can be installed as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/modular-scale).

## Installation

Usage requires Sass. Visit [sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com) to learn more and install.

`gem install modular-scale`

Add `require 'modular-scale'` to your Compass config file.

Import the file into your stylesheets: `@import 'modular-scale';`

## Usage

Modular-scale is used as a function. Simply pass it through in place of any value to generate a value based on a modular scale.

```scss
width: modular-scale(2); // two up the modular scale
width: ms(2); // Shorthand for the line above
width: modular-scale(2, 1em); // two up the modular scale with a base size of 1em
width: modular-scale(2, 1em, octave() ); // Same as above but on an octave scale
```

You can output a list to your terminal to help you find out what values are on your scale.

```scss
@include modular-scale-list($start, $end, $base-size, $ratio);
```

By default, it writes 0-20 on the scale. You can also use shorthand to make things more efficient.

```scss
@include ms-list; // shorthand without attributes
@include ms-list($start, $end, $base-size, $ratio); // shorthand with attributes
```

You can also write the output to your CSS file if you are using the terminal:

```scss
@include ms-list-output($start, $end, $base-size, $ratio);
```

As a side effect of the modular-scale functions a `power` function is also available.

```scss
@include power($base, $power);
```

Sassy Modular Scale can be used as a function, like so:

```scss
// Use as a function. Fill in the multiple, base-size, and ratio
height: modular-scale(7, 16px, golden() );
```



You can also 'lace' multiple ratios together by passing them in as a list (space-separated)

```scss
.lace {
  width: ms(7, 16px, golden() fourth() );
}
```

You can also set the $base-size variable to a list to interrelate two significant known sizes in your design
*note:* the starting point of the scale will always be the *lowest* value in this list

```scss
.multibases {
  width: ms(7, 16px 300px, golden() );
}
```

You can use multiple $base-sizes and multiple $ratios together

```scss
.multibase-multiratio {
  width: ms(7, 16px 300px, golden() fourth() );
}
```

## Ratios

Modular scale includes functions for a number of classic design and musical scale ratios. You can add your own ratios as well.

By default, the variable `$ratio` is set to `golden()`.

<table>

  <tr><th>Function</th><th>Ratio</th><th>Decimal value</th></tr>

  <tr><td>golden()</td><td>1:1.618</td><td>1.618</td></tr>
  <tr><td>double-octave()</td><td>1:4</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>major-twelfth()</td><td>1:3</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>major-eleventh()</td><td>3:8</td><td>2.667</td></tr>
  <tr><td>major-tenth()</td><td>2.5</td><td>2:5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>octave()</td><td>1:2</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>major-seventh()</td><td>8:15</td><td>1.875</td></tr>
  <tr><td>minor-seventh()</td><td>9:16</td><td>1.778</td></tr>
  <tr><td>major-sixth()</td><td>3:5</td><td>1.667</td></tr>
  <tr><td>minor-sixth()</td><td>5:8</td><td>1.6</td></tr>
  <tr><td>fifth()</td><td>2:3</td><td>1.5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>augmented-fourth()</td><td>1:âˆš2</td><td>1.414</td></tr>
  <tr><td>fourth()</td><td>3:4</td><td>1.333</td></tr>
  <tr><td>major-third()</td><td>4:5</td><td>1.25</td></tr>
  <tr><td>minor-third()</td><td>5:6</td><td>1.2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>major-second()</td><td>8:9</td><td>1.125</td></tr>
  <tr><td>minor-second()</td><td>15:16</td><td>1.067</td></tr>

</table>

Add your own ratio in Sass by setting a variable and passing that to modular-scale.

```scss
$my-variable: 1 / 3.14159265;
$ratio: $my-variable;
```
