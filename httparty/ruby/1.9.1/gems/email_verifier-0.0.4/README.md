# Email Verifier

Helper validation utility for checking whether given email address is real or not.
Many times as developers we've put in our models statements for checking email address
*format*. This gem will complete your existing setups with validator that actually
connects with given mail server and asks if given email address exists for real.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'email_verifier'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install email_verifier

## Usage

To get info about realness of given email address, email_verifier connects
with mail server that email's domain points to and pretends to send an email.

Some stmp servers will not allow you to do this if you will not present 
yourself as some real user. So first thing you'd need to set up is to 
put something like this either in initializer or in application.rb file:

    EmailVerifier.config do |config|
      config.verifier_email = "realname@realdomain.com"
    end

Then just put this in your model e. g:
    
    validates_email_realness_of :email

Or - if you'd like to use it outside of your models:

    EmailValidator.check(youremail)

This method will return true or false, or - will throw exception 
with nicely detailed info about what's wrong.

**Still Rails 3+ only** but compatibility with anything in the pipeline.
