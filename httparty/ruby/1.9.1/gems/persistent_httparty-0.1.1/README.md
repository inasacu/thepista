# persistent_httparty

Persistent HTTP connections for HTTParty!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'persistent_httparty'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install persistent_httparty

## Requirements

* [httparty](/jnunemaker/httparty) and [persistent_http](/bpardee/persistent_http)
* You like to `Keep-Alive` the party!

## Usage

Just call `persistent_connection_adapter` and then use HTTParty as
normal.

```ruby
class Twitter
  include HTTParty
  persistent_connection_adapter
end
```

You can also pass in parameters to the `persistent_http` gem. The
regular HTTParty config will be passed through as applicable.

```ruby
class MyCoolRestClient
  include HTTParty
  persistent_connection_adapter { :name => 'my_cool_rest_client',
                                  :pool_size => 2,
                                  :idle_timeout => 10,
                                  :keep_alive => 30 }
end
```
