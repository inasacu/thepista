Getting Started
===============

[Sign up for a IronWorker account][1], it's free to try!

[1]: http://www.iron.io/

Install IronWorker Gem
------------------------

    gem install iron_worker

Configure IronWorker
----------------------

You really just need your token, which you can get [here][2]
[2]: http://hud.iron.io/tokens

    IronWorker.configure do |config|
        config.token = TOKEN
        config.project_id = MY_PROJECT_ID
    end

Write a Worker
--------------

Here's an example worker that sends an email:

    require 'iron_worker'

    class HelloWorker < IronWorker::Base

        attr_accessor :name

        # This is the method that will be run
        def run
            puts "Hello #{name}!"
        end
    end

Test It Locally
---------------

Let's say someone does something in your app and you want to send an email about it.

    worker = HelloWorker.new
    worker.name = "Travis"
    worker.run_local

Once you've got it working locally, the next step is to run it on the IronWorker cloud.

Queue up your Worker on the IronWorker Cloud
----------------------------------------------

Let's say someone does something in your app and you want to send an email about it.

    worker = HelloWorker.new
    worker.name = "Travis"
    worker.queue

This will send it off to the IronWorker cloud.
