== 2.0.3

* 1 new feature

  * Allow searching through relations. Model.join(:relation).search(:relation => {:column => "query"})
    works, and reduces the need for multi-model tables. Huge thanks to Ben Hamill for the pull request.
  * Allow searching through all model columns irrespective of the column's type; we cast all columns to text
    in the search query. Performance may degrade when searching through anything but a string column.

* 2 bugfixes

  * Fix exceptions when adding Texticle to a table-less model.
  * Column names in a search query are now scoped to the current table.

* 1 dev improvement

  * Running `rake` from the project root will setup the test environment by creating a test database
    and running the necessary migrations. `rake` can also be used to run all the project tests.

== 2.0.2

* 1 bugfix

  * Our #respond_to? overwritten method was causing failures when a model didn't have
    a table (e.g. if migrations hadn't been run yet). Not the case anymore.

== 2.0.1

* 1 new feature

  * Can now define #searchable_language to specify the language used for the query. This changes
    what's considered a stop word on Postgres' side. 'english' is the default language.

* 1 bugfix

  * We were only specifying a language in to_tsvector() and not in to_tsquery(), which could
    cause queries to fail if the default database language wasn't set to 'english'.

== 2.0.pre4

* 1 new feature

  * Searchable is now available to specify which columns you want searched:

      require 'texticle/searchable'
      class Game
        extend Searchable(:title)
      end

    This also allows Texticle use in Rails without having #search available to all models:

      gem 'texticle', '~> 2.0.pre4', :require => 'texticle/searchable'

* 1 bugfix

  * ActiveRecord::Base.extend(Texticle) doesn't break #method_missing and #respond_to? anymore


== 2.0.pre3

* 1 new feature

  * #select calls now limit the columns that are searched

* 1 bugfix

  * #search calls without an argument assume an empty string as a search term (it errored out previously)

== 2.0.pre2

* 1 bugfix

  * #respond_to? wasn't overwritten correctly

=== 2.0.pre

* Complete refactoring of Texticle

  * For users:

    * Texticle should only be used for its simplicity; if you need to deeply configure your text search, please give `gem install pg_search` a try.
    * #search method is now included in all ActiveRecord models by default, and searches across a model's :string columns.
    * #search_by_<column> dynamic methods are now available.
    * #search can now be chained; Game.search_by_title("Street Fighter").search_by_system("PS3") works.
    * #search now accepts a hash to specify columns to be searched, e.g. Game.search(:name => "Mario")
    * No more access to #rank values for results (though they're still ordered by rank).
    * No way to give different weights to different columns in this release.

  * For devs:

    * We now have actual tests to run against; this will make accepting pull requests much more enjoyable.
