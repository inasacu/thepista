Further documentation available at:

* http://tenderlove.github.com/texticle

== DESCRIPTION:

Texticle exposes full text search capabilities from PostgreSQL,
extending ActiveRecord with scopes making search easy and fun!

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Only works with PostgreSQL

== SYNOPSIS:

=== Quick Start

* Rails 3

In the project's Gemfile add

    gem 'texticle', '~> 2.0', :require => 'texticle/rails'

* ActiveRecord outside of Rails 3

    require 'texticle'
    ActiveRecord::Base.extend(Texticle)

=== Usage

Your models now have access to the search method:

  Game.search('Sonic') # will search through the model's :string columns
  Game.search(:title => 'Mario')
  Game.search_by_title('Street Fighter').search_by_system('PS3')
  Game.search_by_title_and_system('Final Fantasy', 'PS2')
  Game.search_by_title_or_system('Final Fantasy, 'PS3')

=== Creating Indexes for Super Speed
You can have Postgresql use an index for the full-text search.  To declare a full-text index, in a
migration add code like the following:

  execute "
      create index on email_logs using gin(to_tsvector('english', subject));
      create index on email_logs using gin(to_tsvector('english', email_address));"

In the above example, the table email_logs has two text columns that we search against, subject and email_address.
You will need to add an index for every text/string column you query against, or else Postgresql will revert to a
full table scan instead of using the indexes.


== REQUIREMENTS:
