h1. HasActivity
---------------

A simple way to grab recent activity on a given model from a table grouped by day, hour,
or week with only 1 SQL query and giving the ability to pad the results for days/weeks/hours with no activity.

The plugin offers the ability to...
  * Present as a Google Chart (line or bar)
  * Scope your model to given :conditions
  * Pad your results for days with no activity

NOTE: MySQL only because of date functions use.

  #   * :padding

  #   * :line_width => "2" (only for :line)
  # 
  def to_activity_gchart(options={})
</code></pre>

h2. INDEX THE TIMESTAMP YOU USE

Obviously there is not "one index fits all" but you should include an index on at least the timestamp that fits the conditions you are using.

<pre><code>
add_index :model, [:created_at]
</code></pre>
