  == Session bugs (please read if you are having issues with logging in / out)

Apparently there is a bug with apache / passenger for v2.1.X with sessions not working properly. This is most likely your problem if you are having trouble logging in / out. This is *not* an Authlogic issue. This can be solved by updating passener or using an alternative session store solution, such as active record store.
